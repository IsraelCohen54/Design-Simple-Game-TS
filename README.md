# Design-Simple-Game-TS

This project is a TypeScript game where you control a boat to catch parachutes falling from a moving airplane. As you successfully catch parachutes, your score increases. However, if you miss them, you lose lives.

The game is compiled using the tsc command within the command prompt, leveraging a tsconfig.json file for configuration.

Design Philosophy

The core design philosophy behind this project was to prioritize both clean code and maintainability. The goal was to create a well-structured game that is easy to understand and modify, while still offering engaging gameplay.

Here are some key features of the project:

Object-oriented design principles are used for code organization and maintainability.
The game utilizes separate classes for different entities (airplane, boat, parachutes).
The code adheres to best practices for data encapsulation and separation of concerns.
